# 🌦️ WeatherWise — Smart Weather Advisor
Welcome to **WeatherWise**, a smart weather advisor application that combines live weather data with AI-powered natural language responses.  
This project is based on the **WeatherWise Assignment Starter Template**, enhanced with custom logic, visualisations, and interface design developed by **Waranyu Bancherdvanich**.

## 🧩 Overview
**Features**
- 🌤️ Current weather and 5-day forecast  
- 📈 Temperature and rainfall charts  
- 💬 AI-driven weather questions  
- 🧠 Rule-based outdoor advice (“Should I go outside tomorrow?”)

**Core Components**
- API data retrieval and processing  
- Matplotlib visualisations  
- AI conversation features  
- Interactive UI with `ipywidgets`

**My contribution**
Built the temperature and precipitation visualisations, the data-caching logic that avoids repeated API calls, the corrected "tomorrow" forecast indexing (mapping 3-hour data to full days), and the interactive ipywidgets interface.

## ⚙️ How It Works
**WeatherWise** follows a simple **data → analysis → AI → user output** pipeline:
---
### 🌐 1. Fetch Weather Data
- The app calls the **OpenWeather API** using the selected city and units (°C/°F).  
- Data includes temperature, humidity, rainfall, and a 5-day forecast.
---
### 🧮 2. Process and Organise Data
- Functions like `get_temps()` extract relevant fields (min/max/average).  
- The data is cleaned and structured for visualisation and AI input.
---
### 📊 3. Visualise the Forecast
- `matplotlib` generates **line charts** (temperature) and **bar charts** (rainfall).  
- Users can easily understand weather patterns at a glance.
---
### 🤖 4. AI Interaction
- User questions (e.g., *“Will it rain tomorrow in Perth?”*) are parsed by `parse_weather_question()`.  
- `generate_weather_response()` combines AI analysis with forecast data to produce natural, contextual answers.
---
## 🧭 5. User Interface
**Interactive options (via `ipywidgets`):**
- 📍 Enter location & forecast days  
- ☀️ Fetch Today’s Weather  
- 📈 Show Charts  
- 🤖 Ask AI Question  
- 👋 Quit Session

## 💡 Example
**Example Interaction**
| Step | Action | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Enter: `Perth` | Loads weather data |
| 2 | Click: ☀️ *Fetch Weather* | Shows temperature summary |
| 3 | Ask: “Will it rain tomorrow?” | AI gives contextual advice |
---
## 🎯 Project Purpose
**WeatherWise** integrates APIs, AI, and data visualisation to make weather information more interactive and insightful.  
It demonstrates how natural language and data analytics can support everyday decisions.

## 🧠 AI Conversations
All prompt logs are saved in `/ai-conversations/`.  
See resources for examples and prompting tips.

## 🔍 Known Limitations & Future Improvements
- The question parser uses a simple keyword heuristic to detect location, which can misread the location in some phrasings. A future version could use named-entity recognition for more reliable parsing.
- Outdoor advice is rule-based (temperature thresholds), which is reliable and transparent; a future version could blend this with the AI model for richer suggestions.
